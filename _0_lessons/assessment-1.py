# If Statements
# -------------------------------------------
# Question 1:
Write a Python program that checks if a number entered by the user is positive, negative, or zero.
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Write your if statement here


# Question 2:
Write a Python program that checks if a given year is a leap year. (Hint: A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4, but not by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400).
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))
# Write your if statement here

# For Loops
# -------------------------------------------


# Question 3:
Write a Python program to print numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop.


# Write your for loop here
# Question 4:
Write a Python program that prints the multiplication table of a number entered by the user up to 10.
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
# Write your for loop here

# Lists
# -------------------------------------------

# Question 5:
Write a Python program that prints all the items in a list.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# Write your for loop here to print each fruit

# Question 6:
Write a Python program to find the largest number in a list.
numbers = [3, 5, 7, 2, 8]
# Write your code here to find the largest number

# Question 7:
Write a Python program that prints all the even numbers from a list of numbers.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# Write your code here

# Question 8:
Write a Python program that counts how many times a specific value appears in a list.
numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]
value = int(input("Enter a value to count: "))
# Write your code here

# Question 9:
Write a Python program that prints all numbers from 1 to 20, but for multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".
# Write your code here


# Question 10:
Write a Python program to create a new list that contains the squares of all the numbers in a given list.
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Write your code here
