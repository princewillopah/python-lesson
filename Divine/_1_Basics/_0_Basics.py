# Conclusion: Prometheus Metrics
# Prometheus offers powerful metrics collection capabilities with its four metric types: counter, gauge, histogram, and summary. Each serves specific use cases in monitoring and observability. Understanding these types helps developers choose the right approach for their monitoring needs.

# However, comprehensive application performance monitoring often requires more than what Prometheus alone provides. Stackify’s APM complements Prometheus by offering deep, application-centric insights, code-level performance data, and integrated logging.

# So, when monitoring with Prometheus, choose the appropriate metric type based on your specific monitoring requirements. Consider combining Prometheus with Stackify APM for a turn-key solution that doesn’t require developer cycles spent on maintenance, offers a more comprehensive monitoring strategy, and continuously analyzes your metrics to maintain high-performing, reliable applications.
